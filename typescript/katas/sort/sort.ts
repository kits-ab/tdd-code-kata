 * The sequence must be sorted so that given any two numbers 𝑋 and 𝑌,
 * 𝑋 appears before 𝑌 if the number of times 𝑋 appears in the original sequence is larger than the number of time 𝑌 does.
 * If the number of appearances is equal, the number whose value appears sooner in the input should appear sooner in the sorted sequence.
